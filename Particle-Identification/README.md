# Particle-Identification

The aim of this project is to train a classifier to identify type of a particle using the responses in the detector systems.
There are six particle types: 
+ electron
+ proton
+ muon
+ kaon
+ pion
+ ghost 

**Note:** Ghost is a particle with other type than the first five or a detector noise. <br><br>

Different particle types remain different responses in the detector systems or subdetectors. 
Thre are five systems: 
+ Tracking System
+ Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detector (RICH)
+ Electromagnetic and Hadron Calorimeters
+ Muon system. You task is to i
