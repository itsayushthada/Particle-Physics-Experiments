# Location-Aware Generative Adversarial Networks

This repository is my own implmentaion of LAGAN and the data analysis associated with it. 
All the references from external sources and the official sources ahs been cited within the notebook or the script
as a comment or markdown.

### Project Details

| Properties  | Values  | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| **Domain** | Generative Modeling [Machine Learning] and Physical processes Simualtions [High Energy Particles Physics] |
| **Primary Aim** | Use of GANs for the production of Jet Images.|
| **Secondry Aim** | Samples from generator should be represtaive of given Population ie. given data.|
| **Input** | 2D representations of Energy Depositions from Particles Interacting with a Calorimeter|
| **Output** | Production of realistic radiation Patterns from Simulated High Energy Particle Collisions.|
| **Baseline** | Faster Simulation than MCMC Sampling in High Energy Particle Physics.|
